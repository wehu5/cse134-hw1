## Part 2
1. Were any parts of navigating ESPN site easy? Were any parts difficult?
Easy: It was easy to go through every item. Therefore, I just have to wait until I hear **Top Headlines**.
Difficult: It took me a long time to hear **Top Headlines** because it is located at a far right corner.
2. Were any parts of navigating webaim.org's site easy? Were any parts difficult?
Easy: It was quick to find the answer about archive once the page is correct.
Difficult: There are many similar terms that sound like *Web Accessibility Virtual Training*, and there are many links included in these clickable links. It was easy to enter other pages that do not have the information about archive classes.

2. One obvious broken feature is the search button located top right of the page. When JS is disabled, clicking the magnifying glass pattern does nothing. Also when the website is shrunk to point when the "topics" such as *ABOUT, ACADEMICS, ADMISSIONS AND AID, etc*, are not displayed and they are only visible if the drop down button is clicked, the drop down button does not show the "topics" with JS disabled.

6. The website of UCLA is partially functioning when JavaScript is disabled: most of the content are still visible and clickable; clicking to the buttons or links can still redirect the page to the designated page; however, in the middle of the page, the page loses its visuals and leaves a blank in between the contents.
